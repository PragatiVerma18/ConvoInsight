# Call Analysis and Profanity Detection

This report provides an in-depth analysis of call conversations between debt collection agents and borrowers. It evaluates the effectiveness of profanity detection, privacy violation detection, and call quality metrics using both regex-based and LLM-based approaches. The goal is to improve compliance, enhance agent performance, and ensure a better borrower experience.

## 2. Implementation Recommendations

### 2.1 Profanity Detection

### Approach 1: Regex-Based Detection

The regex-based approach utilizes a predefined list of profane words to identify inappropriate language. While this method is efficient and easy to implement, it has limitations, such as missing variations of profane words or context-dependent usage.

### Approach 2: LLM-Based Detection

The LLM-based detection leverages OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT API to analyze conversation transcripts. This method provides better contextual understanding and can detect profanity even when words are obfuscated or used in indirect expressions.

#### Comparison and Recommendation

| Method                    | Advantages                                         | Disadvantages                                          |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Regex-Based Detection** | Fast, lightweight, easy to implement               | Cannot detect obfuscated words or contextual profanity |
| **LLM-Based Detection**   | Context-aware, detects variations and obfuscations | Computationally expensive                              |

> **Recommendation**: LLM is preferred for high accuracy, but regex can be used as a quick first-pass filter.

### 2.2 Privacy and Compliance Violation Detection

#### Approach 1: Regex-Based Detection

Regex patterns are used to detect sensitive information such as account details, SSN, and balance. However, regex alone cannot verify if an agent has authenticated the borrower before revealing sensitive data.

#### Approach 2: LLM-Based Detection

The LLM-based method analyzes conversations for both sensitive information and verification steps, ensuring that agents comply with security protocols before sharing private details.

#### Comparison and Recommendation

| Method                    | Advantages                                     | Disadvantages                              |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Regex-Based Detection** | Effective in detecting sensitive keywords      | Cannot verify authentication or compliance |
| **LLM-Based Detection**   | Context-aware, ensures compliance verification | Higher computational cost                  |

> **Recommendation**: The LLM approach is preferred for compliance verification, though regex can serve as a supplementary filter.

## 3. Visualization Analysis

### 3.1 Overtalk Percentage

Overtalk is calculated by identifying overlapping speech segments where both the agent and borrower speak simultaneously. The percentage is derived using:

$Overtalk\_Percentage = \left(\frac{Total\ Overtalk\ Duration}{Total\ Call\ Duration}\right) \times 100$

### 3.2 Silence Percentage

Silence periods occur when neither party speaks. Silence percentage is computed as:

$Silence\_Percentage = \left(\frac{Total\ Silence\ Duration}{Total\ Call\ Duration}\right) \times 100$

## 4. Visualization

To analyze call quality, multiple visualization techniques were employed:

### 4.1 Pie Chart Representation

A pie chart is used to illustrate the proportions of silence, overtalk, and normal conversation during calls. This visualization provides an intuitive breakdown of call quality metrics.

### 4.2 Bar Chart Representation

A horizontal bar chart (Gantt Chart style) represents silence, overtalk, and normal conversation percentages. This allows for quick comparison between different metrics.

### 4.3 Dual Line Chart for Speaker Activity

A dual line chart plots the speaking activity of both the agent and the borrower over time. It highlights overtalk segments by shading overlapping speech intervals, making it easier to analyze conversation dynamics.

## 5. Use Cases

The insights derived from this analysis can be applied in the following scenarios:

1. **Agent Training**: Identify areas where agents need improvement, such as avoiding overtalk or ensuring compliance with privacy protocols.
2. **Compliance Monitoring**: Ensure that agents follow regulatory guidelines when handling sensitive information.
3. **Customer Experience Improvement**: Reduce silence and overtalk to create smoother, more engaging conversations.
4. **Performance Evaluation**: Use call quality metrics to evaluate agent performance and reward top performers.

## 6. Challenges and Limitations

1. **Regex-Based Detection**:

   - Limited to predefined patterns and cannot handle context or obfuscated words.
   - Requires frequent updates to the regex patterns to adapt to new scenarios.

2. **LLM-Based Detection**:

   - Computationally expensive and may require significant resources for large-scale analysis.
   - Dependent on the quality of the training data and may occasionally produce false positives or negatives.

3. **Call Quality Metrics**:
   - Silence and overtalk percentages may vary depending on the nature of the conversation (e.g., technical support vs. debt collection).
   - Dual line charts require accurate timestamps, which may not always be available in real-world data.

## 7. Future Enhancements

1. **Sentiment Analysis**:

   - Incorporate sentiment analysis to evaluate the emotional tone of conversations and identify dissatisfied customers.

2. **Real-Time Monitoring**:

   - Develop real-time monitoring tools to detect profanity, privacy violations, and call quality issues during live calls.

3. **Multi-Language Support**:

   - Extend the analysis to support multiple languages for global operations.

4. **Advanced Visualizations**:

   - Add more advanced visualizations, such as heatmaps for speaker activity or word clouds for frequently used terms.

5. **Customizable Metrics**:
   - Allow users to define custom metrics based on their specific business needs.

## 8. Technical Implementation

1. **Data Preprocessing**:

   - Conversation data is preprocessed to extract speaker activity, timestamps, and text content.
   - Sensitive information is masked to ensure data privacy during analysis.

2. **Regex-Based Detection**:

   - Predefined regex patterns are applied to detect profanity and sensitive information.

3. **LLM-Based Detection**:

   - OpenAI's ChatGPT API is used to analyze conversations for context-aware detection of profanity and privacy violations.

4. **Visualization Tools**:
   - Visualizations are created using `matplotlib` and integrated into a Streamlit-based dashboard for interactive analysis.

## 9. Conclusion

- Regex-based methods are efficient but limited in context-aware detection.
- LLM-based methods provide better accuracy and compliance tracking but come at higher costs.
- Visualizations effectively highlight call quality insights, aiding in performance evaluation.
